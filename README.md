## Project/Goals
Project Title: Airbnb Listing Analysis and Visualization

Project Summary:
The project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from Airbnb listings. Leveraging Tableau's capabilities, the dataset is explored through various perspectives, uncovering insights on registration forecasts, host profitability, trends, correlations, and more.

## Process
### Step 1
Data Exploration:

  Objective: Gain familiarity with the raw Airbnb listing dataset.
  
  Activities:
    Initial data loading and inspection.
    Understanding dataset structure and attributes.
  
### Step 2
Data Cleaning:

  Objective: Address and rectify any inconsistencies, missing values, or anomalies in the dataset.
  
  Activities:  
    Identifying issues to be handled like - missing data, data outliers and inconsistencies and data fromat standardizing issues

### Step 3 
Framework Development:
  
  Objective: Establish a structured framework for conducting the analysis based on identified dimensions and measures.
  
  Activities:
    Defining dimensions and measures of interest.
    Structuring the analysis framework for comprehensive insights extraction.
    Following were the analysis aspects created - Geographical Analysis and Host Rating Analysis

### Step 4
Geographical Analysis:
  Objective: Analyze and visualize data patterns across different geographies.
  Sub-Objectives and Activities:
    Platform Registration Rate Analysis:
      Yearly and monthly registration trends visualization.
      Geographical distribution of registration rates.
    Impact of External Events:
      Assessing and visualizing the influence of external events on registration rates.
    Pricing and BNB Type Preferences:
      Analyzing pricing trends across geographies.
      Preference analysis for different BNB types.
    Forecasting:
      Developing forecasting models for platform registration and pricing trends across geographies.

### Step 5
Host Rating Analysis:
Objective: Investigate host ratings and their correlations with various factors.
Sub-Objectives and Activities:
  Correlation Analysis:
    Assessing correlations between host ratings and pricing.
  Profitability Analysis:
    Identifying and clustering hosts based on profitability metrics like review count and pricing.
  Dashboard Creation:
    Designing interactive dashboards showcasing top hosts across geographies and room categories.

### Step 6 
Documentation and Reporting:
Objective: Document the analysis methodologies, findings, and insights for clear communication and reference in the form of presentation and dashboard.
Activities:
  Compiling analysis results.
  Creating detailed documentation and reports highlighting key insights and recommendations.

## Results
For this project Option 2 was selected and within this option, the NY Airbnb dataset was picked for analysis. Results and analysis of this activity are listed below - 
1. Registration trend analysis - For certain geographies like Manhattan and Brooklyn, there has been a significant growth in the registration trend on the platform from 2008 to 2015.
2. Pricing Trend Analysis - Median pricing in Brooklyn, Staten and Queens has been dropping from 2008 to 2015. The magnitude of drop is not very high.
